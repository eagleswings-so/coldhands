Chapter 2: Embers of Curiosity

As the Snow Festival continued, Adrian found himself caught up in a whirlwind of activity. The line at his cocoa booth seemed never-ending, and his left hand, while cold to the touch, radiated an intense heat whenever he interacted with someone. He marveled at how the festival-goers didn't seem to notice the contradiction. Their smiles and compliments warmed his heart, overshadowing his worries.

Lily was a constant presence by his side, her infectious enthusiasm helping to keep his anxiety at bay. "See, Adrian, people love your cocoa!" she exclaimed, pointing to the growing line.

He chuckled, a genuine warmth spreading across his face. "Thanks to you, Lily. I couldn't have done this without your encouragement."

As the evening progressed, Adrian's booth became a focal point of the festival. News of the unique hot cocoa experience spread, and people lined up for a taste of both the delicious drink and the enigma of his cold hand. Whispers and curious glances followed him as he moved among the crowd, each encounter fueling his newfound confidence.

In the midst of the festivities, a stranger emerged from the crowd. He was tall and well-dressed, his coat adorned with intricate embroidery. His sharp eyes locked onto Adrian's booth, and with purposeful steps, he approached.

"Good evening," the stranger greeted, his voice smooth and cultured. "I've heard quite the tale about your hot cocoa. Might I have a taste?"

Adrian nodded, feeling a mixture of excitement and unease. He prepared a cup of cocoa and extended his cold hand to offer it to the stranger. As their fingers brushed, Adrian felt the usual surge of heat, but he also noticed a flicker of curiosity in the stranger's eyes.

The stranger took a slow sip, savoring the flavor. "Remarkable," he mused, his gaze never leaving Adrian's face. "You have a rare gift, young man."

Before Adrian could respond, the stranger turned and melted into the crowd, leaving him with a sense of intrigue and a barrage of unanswered questions.
